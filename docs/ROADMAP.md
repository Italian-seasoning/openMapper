# openMapper: road to 1.0

openMapper 0.1 already opens, edits and saves OMSI 2 maps (roads with automatic junctions,
objects, terrain, painting, tiles, game logic, import, test drive). What keeps it from being
a complete editor, and who works on what.

## Workstreams

Each stream has its own branch and owns its files. Shared files (`src/ui.rs`,
`src/editor.rs`, `src/app.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/i18n.rs`, `src/icons.rs`) are touched
only with small hooks: a new menu item, a new `Action`, a call into the stream's module. Big
pieces of code go into new files.

| Stream | Branch | Owns | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. Timetable | `feature/timetable` | `src/timetable/` (new), `src/ui_timetable.rs` (new) | Lines, trips and tours (`TTData`): stops picked from the map, the route found along the splines between them, times; written in OMSI 2's formats so the map can be driven in service, not only freely |
| B. Editing | `feature/editing` | `src/editor.rs` (selection, drag, spline edit), `src/clipboard.rs` (new) | Multi-select (Shift-click, box), copy / paste / duplicate, numeric position and height, moving road ends and reshaping a road after it is drawn, snapping |
| C. Quality | `feature/quality` | `src/render/`, `src/doc/`, `src/check.rs` (new) | Map check (missing files, unlinked splines, stops off a path, start points off a road), speed on big maps (Berlin-Spandau), safe saving (backup, atomic writes), tests |
| D. Integration | `main` | `README.md`, `docs/`, merging | Merges the streams, keeps the README true, overview map, release polish |

## Rules for everyone

* Every user-facing text goes through `tr("English", "Русский")`.
* Follow the code around you: short comments that say why, no dead code.
* Commit often on your branch with plain messages. **No AI mentions anywhere**: no
  `Co-Authored-By` trailers, no "Generated with", nothing in code comments.
* `cargo build --release` and `cargo test --release` pass before every commit.
* Never write into the OMSI 2 installation; maps and generated content go into openOMSI's
  content folder.
* Check visually with `OPENMAPPER_SHOT=out.png ./target/release/openmapper path/to/global.cfg`.
* When you add a shared hook (new `Action`, new menu entry), note it in the log below so the
  merge is easy.

## Hooks log

Add a line when you touch a shared file: stream, file, what.
