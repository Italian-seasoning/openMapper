# openMapper: road to 1.0

openMapper 0.1 already opens, edits and saves OMSI 2 maps (roads with automatic junctions,
objects, terrain, painting, tiles, game logic, import, test drive). What keeps it from being
a complete editor, and who works on what.

## Workstreams

Each stream has its own branch and owns its files. Shared files (`src/ui.rs`,
`src/editor.rs`, `src/app.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/i18n.rs`, `src/icons.rs`) are touched
only with small hooks: a new menu item, a new `Action`, a call into the stream's module. Big
pieces of code go into new files.

| Stream | Branch | Owns | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. Timetable | `feature/timetable` | `src/timetable/` (new), `src/ui_timetable.rs` (new) | Lines, trips and tours (`TTData`): stops picked from the map, the route found along the splines between them, times; written in OMSI 2's formats so the map can be driven in service, not only freely |
| B. Editing | `feature/editing` | `src/editor.rs` (selection, drag, spline edit), `src/clipboard.rs` (new) | Multi-select (Shift-click, box), copy / paste / duplicate, numeric position and height, moving road ends and reshaping a road after it is drawn, snapping |
| C. Quality | `feature/quality` | `src/render/`, `src/doc/`, `src/check.rs` (new) | Map check (missing files, unlinked splines, stops off a path, start points off a road), speed on big maps (Berlin-Spandau), safe saving (backup, atomic writes), tests |
| D. Integration | `main` | `README.md`, `docs/`, merging | Merges the streams, keeps the README true, overview map, release polish |

## Rules for everyone

* Every user-facing text goes through `tr("English", "Русский")`.
* Follow the code around you: short comments that say why, no dead code.
* Commit often on your branch with plain messages. **No AI mentions anywhere**: no
  `Co-Authored-By` trailers, no "Generated with", nothing in code comments.
* `cargo build --release` and `cargo test --release` pass before every commit.
* Never write into the OMSI 2 installation; maps and generated content go into openOMSI's
  content folder.
* Check visually with `OPENMAPPER_SHOT=out.png ./target/release/openmapper path/to/global.cfg`.
* When you add a shared hook (new `Action`, new menu entry), note it in the log below so the
  merge is easy.

## Hooks log

Add a line when you touch a shared file: stream, file, what.
* D · `src/ui.rs`: `Action::LookAt(DVec2)`, `UiState::minimap`, `Status::cam`, View menu "Overview map", minimap drawn in the central panel; welcome list maps a recent installation map to its content copy.
* D · `src/app.rs`: `Status::cam` filled, `Action::LookAt` handled, key `M` toggles the overview map.
* D · `src/main.rs`: `mod ui_minimap`.
* D · `src/ui.rs`: `Action::ToggleFavourite`, `Action::UsedAsset`, `UiState::{favourites, recent_assets}`; `catalogue`, `logic_panel`, `catalogue_of` take `actions`; favourites / recently used groups and a right-click menu in the catalogue.
* D · `src/install.rs`: `Prefs::{favourites, recent_assets}`.
* D · `src/app.rs`: `OPENMAPPER_TOOL` also takes `roads` and `objects`.
* D · `src/ui.rs`: `Action::MapPicture`, `Action::SetMapCamera`; `map_properties` takes `st` and `actions` and shows the map's picture.
* D · `src/app.rs`: `read_frame` (split from `save_shot`), `save_map_picture`, `[mapcam]` from the camera.
* D · `src/ui.rs`: `Action::SetScale`, "Interface size" in `lang_menu`; `src/install.rs`: `Prefs::ui_scale`; `src/app.rs`: zoom applied at start and on change.
* B · `src/ui.rs`: `Action::Copy / Cut / Paste / Duplicate / SelectAll` and Edit menu entries; `check`, `section`, `prop_row`, `TEXT_DIM` made `pub(crate)` for `ui_edit.rs`; properties: several selected go to `ui_edit::group_properties`, object X / Y are numbers (`Editor::put_object`), a spline's ends via `ui_edit::spline_ends` / `apply_ends` (the old Gradient row went); status bar: `ui_edit::snap_controls`; Select hint and Controls rows.
* B · `src/app.rs`: Ctrl+C / X / V / D / A push the new actions and they are handled; Shift / Ctrl + left press on empty ground starts `ed.select_box`, cursor moves update it, release calls `ed.finish_box`; `ui_edit::paint_box` after `ui::editor`; undo / redo use `ed.select(None)`.
* B · `src/main.rs`: `mod clipboard`, `mod reshape`, `mod selection`, `mod ui_edit`.
* B · `src/render/mod.rs`: `FrameExtras::selected_more` (a `HashSet<Sel>`), tinted like `selected` and part of the scene key.
* B · `src/doc/mod.rs`: `Sel` derives `Hash`.
* B · `Editor::selected` stays the one shown in the properties; the rest of a selection is `Editor::also` (meaningless while `selected` is None). Use `ed.select(..)` / `ed.selection()` rather than writing `selected` when it matters.
* A · `src/main.rs`: `mod timetable`.
* A · `src/doc/mod.rs`: `Document::timetable` (read with the map in `load`, empty in `new_map`), counted in `is_dirty`.
* A · `src/doc/save.rs`: `crate::timetable::save(doc)` after `global.cfg` (writes only the changed TTData files).
* A · `src/main.rs`: `mod ui_timetable`.
* A · `src/ui.rs`: `Action::Timetable`; Map menu "Lines and timetable…" (key `L`).
* A · `src/app.rs`: `App::tt` (the Lines window): drawn after `ui::editor`, its route laid into the frame's extras after `Editor::extras`, `before_save` in `App::save`, `Action::Timetable` and key `L` toggle it; `OPENMAPPER_TIMETABLE=<line>[:tours]` opens it on a line, and with `OPENMAPPER_DEMO` adds stops and a line to the demo map (checks without a person at the screen); `Action::Force` also drops the timetable's changes.
* C · `src/main.rs`: `mod check;` and `openmapper --check path/to/global.cfg` (checks a map without a window).
* C · `src/ui.rs`: `UiState::check` (the map check window), Map > Check map…, the window drawn at the end of `editor()`.
* C · `src/app.rs`: `OPENMAPPER_PROFILE` timings round the editor, the interface, acquiring the frame and submitting it; the camera turning by itself with `OPENMAPPER_PROFILE=orbit`; screenshot and profiling runs go on when the window gets no redraws; `OPENMAPPER_CHECK=1` opens the map check.
* C · `src/gpu.rs`: no vsync while profiling.
* C · `src/ui.rs`: `Action::RestoreBackup(PathBuf)`, File > Earlier versions… (`UiState::versions_open`, the window is `doc::safe::versions_window`).
* C · `src/app.rs`: autosave (`App::autosave`, ticked after the frame's actions, not while the left button is down or an edit is open), the offer at start (`App::recover`, `doc::autosave::offer`), the autosave cleared on save, close, opening or making another map and a normal quit; `Action::RestoreBackup` handled (guarded like Open); the save error says the changes are still there.
* C · `src/timetable/tests.rs`: `one_map()` takes the crate-wide `doc::one_map()` lock (the grid is global: Spandau's tests and the round trips of other maps must not run at once).
* A · `src/editor.rs`: `Editor::{pick_mode, picked}`: with pick mode on, a left click with the Select tool only notes what is under the cursor and where (the Lines window picks stops so: nothing is selected or dragged).
* A · `src/history.rs`: `Step::{timetable, at}`, `Snapshot` and `History::push_snapshot` (a window's edit given as the state before it; edits of one kind within 1.5 s are one step); `apply` swaps the timetable too (`Timetable::restored` has every file written again).
* A · `src/main.rs`: `mod traffic`, `mod ui_traffic`.
* A · `src/doc/mod.rs`: `Document::traffic` (`ailists.cfg`, unscheduled traffic, parked cars, people; read in `load`, from the template in `new_map`), counted in `is_dirty`.
* A · `src/doc/save.rs`: `crate::traffic::save(doc)` after the timetable's (only the changed files).
* A · `src/selection.rs` (tests' `flat_map`): `traffic: Default::default()`.
* A · `src/history.rs`: `Step::traffic`, `Snapshot::traffic`.
* A · `src/ui.rs`: `Action::Traffic`; Map menu "Traffic and AI…" (key `T`).
* A · `src/app.rs`: `App::traffic` (the Traffic and AI window) drawn after the Lines window, `Action::Traffic` and key `T`; `OPENMAPPER_TRAFFIC=day|groups|lists` opens it on a tab; `Action::Force` drops the traffic's changes too.
* B (round 2) · `src/app.rs`: `U` toggles the ruler; the Select tool's empty-ground press goes to the editor while the ruler is on; `ed.paste(&self.lib)`.
* B (round 2) · `src/ui.rs`: the properties panel is in a `ScrollArea`; an object hanging on another (`[attachObj]`) is shown through `selection::any_object` / `any_object_mut` (no X / Y, a "Hangs on" row); a road's properties end with `ui_edit::rows_section`; Controls row for `U`.
* B (round 2) · `src/main.rs`: `mod rows`.

* C · `src/install.rs`: `Prefs::save` writes through `doc::safe::write_atomic` (a warning in the log when it fails).
* C · `src/gpu.rs`: `SAMPLES` went; `Gpu::samples` and `Gpu::set_samples` (MSAA chosen by the graphics quality; 1 draws the view straight into the frame).
* C · `src/install.rs`: `Prefs::graphics` ("low" / "medium" / "high", empty: high).
* C · `src/ui.rs`: `Action::SetGraphics(render::quality::Quality)`, View > Graphics quality.
* C · `src/app.rs`: the renderer made with the quality from the settings (`Renderer::new(&gpu, quality)`, `OPENMAPPER_GRAPHICS` overrides for checks); `Action::SetGraphics` makes the renderer again (thumbnails freed); `OPENMAPPER_PROFILE=gpu` times the view on a picture of its own (`Renderer::time_gpu`).
